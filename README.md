A neural network that is able to compose poetry


I taught a neural network on a small dataset of Khayyam's poems. This neural network is able to generate a new character for each input character. It is noteworthy that despite the small amount of data, this recursive network has been able to recognize the pattern between words well, and in some cases, the rhyme and poetic style have been preserved. I am curious to know if we train this network on  a larger dataset of poems,what will happen?

A number of created poems:

Life keeps oozing day

            mone, or prepared we loving year

shrinks as was--the nothing the fire of life kiss and field,

            nor whence it to the tavern caught kindle to that
