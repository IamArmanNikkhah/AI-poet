A neural network that is able to compose poetry


In this project, I proposed a novel approach to generate new poems in the style of Khayyam using a fine-tuned recurrent neural network (RNN) on a small dataset of Khayyam's poetry. The RNN effectively learns the intricate structure, rhyme, and poetic style, producing coherent and stylistically consistent poems. This technique demonstrates the potential of neural networks in natural language processing tasks, particularly for generating creative content in the domain of poetry.

A number of created poems:

    Life keeps oozing day

            mone, or prepared we loving year

    shrinks as was--the nothing the fire of life kiss and field,

            nor whence it to the tavern caught kindle to that
